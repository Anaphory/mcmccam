        Examples
        ========

        1: Copying, without mutation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Imagine three equally connected nodes
        >>> matrix = numpy.array([[0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]])

        that start in three different states
        >>> start = ["A", "B", "C"]

        out of a total of 5 different states
        >>> nlang = 5

        and no history of change yet.

        Assume no mutations, and also assume that no changes have happened yet.

        >>> h = History(start, [])

        If the first change is at time 0.2, it will have equal probability of
        changing node 0 to B (copied from node 1) or C (copied from node 2);
        changing node 1 to A or C, or changing node 2 to A or B â€“ so each has
        probability 1/6.

        >>> h.calculate_event_likelihood(0, "B", 0.2, matrix, 0.0, 5)
        0.16666666666666666
        >>> h.calculate_event_likelihood(1, "A", 0.2, matrix, 0.0, 5)
        0.16666666666666666

        No other change has positive probability.
        >>> for i in "A", "D", "E":
        ...   print(h.calculate_event_likelihood(0, "D", 0.2, matrix, 0.0, 5))
        0.0
        0.0
        0.0

        2: Copying or mutation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Assume the same example as above, but now assume that mutations happen
        with half the rate of anything being copied.

        >>> mu = 0.5

        Then each of the three nodes still has the same probability of being
        the target of a change (1/3), but each copying is twice as likely as a
        random mutation, so if we focus on node 0 as the target of a change: In
        2 out of 5 cases it copies a B from node 1, in 2/5 cases it copies a C
        from node 2, and with probability 1/25 each, it takes a new value of A,
        B, C, D, or E.

        So the probability of a change to A, D, or E is 1/(25*3), whereas a
        change to B or C happens in 2/(5*3) + 1/(25*3) of cases.

        Of course, if all starting values are identical and no mutations

        The probability to see this history after 2 time units is composed of

         - The probability that the first change happen at t=0.5. There are two
           possible change events, each happening with rate 0.5 (mutation rate
           1 and probability 1/2 of an actual change upon mutation), so this
           probability is exp(-0.5).

         - The probability that â€“ given that a change does happen at t=0.5 â€“
           node 0 then flips to B. The only other possible change is that node
           1 flips to B, which happens at the same rate, so this has
           probability 1/2.

           >>> h.calculate_change_likelihood(0, "B", 0.5, matrix, mu, 2)
           0.5

        >>> numpy.exp(h.loglikelihood(0.5, matrix, mu, 2)) == numpy.exp(-0.5) * 0.5
        True

         - The probability that the second change happen at t=1.0. Now there
           are four possible observable change events, the two mutations (rate
           1/2 each) and node 0 copying from node 1 or vice versa (rate 1
           each). A waiting time of 1/2 given a rate of 3 has probability

# GOALS:
# (a) A Gibbs operator that changes the value intervall between two subsequent changes of one node, based on all changes on adjacent nodes that interact with this change [ie. all that have either the old or the new value]
# (b) A Gibbs operator that changes the position of a change between the change before and the change after. This includes creating a change, from sliding it in from before the start/after the endof the observed interval, or deleting a change, from sliding it out of the observed interval.
# (c) A pair of reversible jump operators which split a change into two or merge two adjacent changes into one.
